‘Week’ is a noun and refers to a period of seven days in a row. Generally, it is used to mean the established Sunday through Saturday that occupies a row in a standard calendar, but it can mean any consecutive seven day period. For example: What are you doing this week? This example refers to the standard calendar week. Another example: I am going on vacation for a week. This refers to a week of any seven days together in a row. In British English, ‘week’ is commonly used to mean a time seven days before or after a specific date. For example: Last Monday week, I started my new job. Finally in Business English, ‘week’ is used to mean the days from Monday through Friday when people usually work. For example: I get two weeks paid vacation. This statement means an equivalent of the total of 10 days of pay, not 14, because ‘week’ means working days only. It is understood in a working or business context, that ‘week’ refers only to the days a person normally works in a week. ‘Weak’, on the other hand, has an entirely different meaning. It means having little physical power or ability, as in not strong. This can be used to mean physical strength or vigor. For example: I felt weak after having the flu all week. When used in conjunction with a body part, it means easily upset. For example: She has a weak stomach, and can’t take smelly foods. ’Weak’ can also be used with inanimate objects to indicate having little power, intensity or force. For example: The light became very weak before it died out. As well, it can mean not able to sustain or exert much weight, pressure or strain, and therefore not able to resist external forces or attack. Because of this, the object is thought likely to break or stop working. For example: Be careful what you put on that table, it is weak. ‘Weak’ can, too, mean that something is diluted or deficient in the necessary ingredients. For example: That coffee is too weak. In a chemical sense related to this, it can refer to something that ionizes only slightly in solution, such as a weak acid or base. In a more abstract sense, ‘weak’ can mean not firmly decided or unsure. Along with this is the meaning, it can be used mean to not be able to withstand persuasion or temptation. For example: His resolve not to eat the dessert was weak. ‘Weak’ can likewise take on the meaning of not well grounded or factual. For example: Her argument on the subject was very weak. A person may also say that they are weak at doing something, meaning that their skills are lacking. For example: Math is my weakest subject. Finally, ‘weak’ has a linguistic meaning, in which it means little or no stress. For example: That is a weak syllable and not stressed.
Anxiety is a kind of emotion, while schizophrenia is a mental disorder.
Schizophrenia has worse effects on a person than anxiety.
Anxiety and schizophrenia can both be caused by past traumatic events and intake of illegal drugs, but the latter’s major cause is a genetic predisposition Anxiety does not lead to schizophrenia, but schizophrenics are always anxious.
Schizophrenics have trouble distinguishing the real from the imaginary, while people who suffer from anxiety do not. Medications and therapies are available for both.
The bazooka and the RPG are both tank busters. They specialize in piercing through armored plating, and carry a lot of explosive firepower. The bazooka was developed before the RPG.
The bazooka was first manufactured by the United States and used during World War II. The RPG, on the other hand, was conceptualized by the Russians and inspired by the designs of the bazooka and the German Panzer Faust.
The bazooka stores its payload in an inner chamber by the rear end of the tube; the RPG’s payload is at the front.
The bazooka stores its payload in an inner chamber by the rear end of the tube; the RPG’s payload is at the front. The inner chamber of the RPG is used to trap exhaust pressure and propel the payload at great speed.
Allah and Muhammad are central figures in Islam. Allah is the supreme god in Muslim worship, while Muhammad is his prophet and messenger.
The main difference between Allah and Muhammad is that Allah is the Creator and Muhammad is the creation (in extension, the founder of Islam).
Muslims give worship to Allah and high respect to Muhammad. Respect is also given to other prophets that came before Muhammad. This is recognized by adding the phrase “peace be upon him” when their names are mentioned.
Muhammad has a special and prominent position in Islam because he is the founding father of Islam. He is the last prophet and messenger, which signifies the fulfillment of Allah’s other revelations and prophets.
Other prophets from the Judeo-Christian tradition are included as Allah’s prophets. They are Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.
oth heart attacks and strokes are life and death situations that can cause hospitalization or even death. However, some people confuse the meanings of the terms. Though heart attacks and strokes may arise from the same lifestyle factors, there are fundamental differences between them. A Heart Attack occurs when blood supply is cut off to a portion of the heart muscles. This may happen due to a clot in one of the arteries that supply the heart with blood. WhenÂ blood flow to the heart is obstructed the symptoms of the heart attack are felt by the patient. These may include chest pain, breathlessness etc. A stroke is a similar thing that happens to a brain. When the supply of blood to the brain stops because of a clot in one of the arteries, it is called a stroke.
The important thing to understand is that a heart attack takes place in the heart, while a stroke takes place in the brain.
A person shows different symptoms for the conditions. Let’s take a look at the typical symptoms that may indicate a heart attack: Most heart attacks are not the sort you will find in movies. Most start off with a mild pain and tightness in the chest. In fact, the symptoms may be so negligible that a person might be tempted to ignore them altogether. If you feel a discomfort in the middle of the chest, breathlessness or a feeling of being squeezed, get a doctor immediately. While it is possible that your symptoms may not be those of a heart attack, you do not want to lose time in case they are. You should also be careful if you feel dizzy, experience discomfort around your jaws, arms or shoulders. Other symptoms of a heart attack may include breaking out in a cold sweat, lightheadedness or nausea. If a patient displays any of the following symptoms, he may be having a stroke: A sudden weakness or numbness in the face arms or legs, particularly those concentrated on a specific side of the body. Sudden confusion or a difficulty to understand or speak. A sudden inability to see in one or both eyes A sudden trouble in doing any one of these- walking, maintaining balance or coordinating movements A sudden and severe headache without a known reason.
The terms windmill primarily refers to a wind-powered machine that converts the energy of wind to pump water or grind or mill grains such as wheat or corn and turn them into flour for bread making. It harnesses the power of wind directly and converts it into mechanical energy by means of vanes called sails or blades. Wind turbine is a mechanical device that converts the kinetic energy of wind to generate large amounts of electricity without generating harmful gases. Wind turbine technology is one of the most effective and low-cost sources of renewable energy that use wind power to generate electricity for distribution. Wind turbines work on a simple principle. It usually consists of two to three large propeller-like blades which turn around a rotor when the wind blows and the rotor is connected to the main shaft. When the wind blows, the blades of the turbine start to spin which in turn drives an electrical generator to generate electricity.
Windmills contain enormous blades which move in a circular motion when wind blows against those blades which in turn spin a shaft. The shaft then prompts a generator which is connected to the blades to generate electricity. The blades of a wind turbine operate on the principle of lift and drag. They exploit the aerodynamic forces which generate when the wind blows against the blades and the blades then move relative to the wind. Just like aeroplane wings, the blades on the wind turbine generate lift due to the curved shape of the blades. As wind passes over the aerofoil, a low air pressure generates on the side with most curve while the high pressure air is pushed to the side of the aerofoil.
In windmills, a pressure difference is created over the different regions when the wind blows over the blades causing the blades to rotate. Windmills convert the energy of wind into rotational energy which is mainly used for water pumping. However, they are commercially used for electricity generation. They work efficiently in worst of the environmental conditions and extreme temperatures. From pumping water to crushing to shredding rocks and agricultural material, windmills serve a wide range of purposes based on applications. Wind turbines are commercially used to generate electricity to power homes, schools, or businesses. Even local government and municipalities benefit from the commercial scale wind power.
– Both Quick Sort and Merge Sort are the divide-and-conquer-based sorting algorithms with the same basic principle – to divide a problem into two or more sub-problems and then solve them recursively. However, they differ in the merge procedures and in terms of performance. Quick Sort is generally better and faster than other sorting algorithms including Merge Sort when it comes to small data set, whereas Merge Sort maintains consistency regardless of the type of data sets. Quick Sort is ideally preferred for arrays whereas Merge Sort is ideally preferred for Linked Lists. – The sorting in Quick Sort algorithm is done recursively, and each recursive call requires stack place. It does not require extra space for merging, except a single m
 The sorting in Quick Sort algorithm is done recursively, and each recursive call requires stack place. It does not require extra space for merging, except a single memory space for merging. As it is an in-place sorting algorithm, no additional space is required to perform sorting. In fact, it uses the same array while dividing and merging the array. In Merge Sort, on the other hand, there are several ways of representing data in a file or as an array, so it needs such work areas as sub-files or arrays of the same size which require extra space.
 – The worst case behavior for Quick Sort occurs when the partitioning is unbalanced which depends on which elements are used for partitioning, in which case, the algorithm runs asymptotically as slowly as insertion sort. The worst case performance of the Quick Sort is O (n 2 ) and is left as an exercise. However, it can be avoided by choosing the right pivot. The worst case of Merge Sort, on the other hand, occurs when it has to do maximum number of comparisons. Considering the linear performance for merging, the worst case performance of the Merge Sort is O (n log 2 n).
 – Although both Quick Sort and Merge Sort algorithms are based on the divide and conquer approach for sorting, they differ by the methods used to perform the split and the merge procedures. For Quick Sort, the bulk of work is to partition the list into two sub-lists which takes place before the sub-lists are sorted.
For Merge Sort, the bulk of work is to merge two sub-lists which takes place after the sub-lists are sorted. Merge Sort requires a temporary array for merging two sub-arrays, whereas no additional array space is required for Quick Sort, making it more space efficient than Marge Sort.
Chickenpox: Chickenpox is a contagious disease caused by infection with varicella-zoster virus. Shingles: Shingles is an infection of a nerve and the skin around it, caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus.
 Chickenpox : All ages are susceptible to chickenpox, but it is much more common in children. Shingles : The shingles occurs in adults.
Chickenpox: The transmission of the virus is by an air-droplet pathway. The contagion occurs when droplets containing the virus, formed by the sneezing or coughing of an infected person, fall in the airways or the eyes of other people. Shingles: After chickenpox, the infectious agent remains latent in the nerve ganglia of the body.
Chickenpox : The chickenpox is a primary infection. Shingles : The shingles is a reactivation of old infection.
Chickenpox: The symptoms of chickenpox are fever and itching rash. The rash appears, starting from the corpse and always affects the hairy part of the head. On the face the rash is scarce, and at the palms and soles it is almost missing. Shingles: Pre-existing symptoms such as fatigue, muscle pain, burning, and tingling in the area of the skin, which will later be affected by the rash may occur. This can be accompanied by fever. The shingles proceeds with very severe pain and rash. The rash affects a skin area innervated from a particular peripheral nerve.
Chickenpox: Itching, non-grouped vesicles. Shingles: Painful, grouped vesicles.
Chickenpox : The chickenpox is rarely complicated. Shingles : The shingles may lead to complications more often.
The Roman Catholic Pope is the head of Catholicism, while the Buddha is the symbol of Buddhist faith.
Both Catholicism and Buddhism employ religious props. Catholicism has the rosary and scapular, while Buddhism has prayer beads.
The first major difference between the two religions is the belief in God; Catholicism believes in an omnipresent, omnipotent God, the Almighty Father, while Buddhism does not. The closest thing to God would be Siddhartha Gautama, the first Buddha to achieve spiritual enlightenment.
 The second major difference pertains to the afterlife; Buddhism believes in reincarnation, while Catholicism does not.
The third major difference pertains to religious texts; Catholicism has a standard-issue text, the Bible, while Buddhism relies on word of mouth, the Pali Cannon, and sutras for reference.
“Legal” and “ethical” both function as adjectives and nouns. They have different origins –“legal” comes from Anglo-French, while “ethical” has Middle English and Greek roots. However, both share a common ground in Latin.
There is a difference in scope and application. “Legal” can apply to a more widespread scope, while “ethical” applies on an individual basis.
“Legal” has its basis in ethics, while “ethics” has its basis in morals. They both judge a certain behavior or action either as right or wrong in their respective opinions.
“Legal” has a more objective view, while “ethics” has a personal and varied view depending on the individual.
