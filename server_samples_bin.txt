In the equalist approach, everyone starts from the same level, and everyone is considered in the same way, without prejudice or bias; and In the equalist perspective, there is no “other” as everyone is equal and there are no categorizations. Conversely, feminists often see men as “the other,” although it is worth noting that there are various degrees of feminism, with some activists taking a more radical approach and others maintaining a moderate perspective.
Obama’s administration started in the throes of the recession period. Thus, one of his biggest priorities during the initial years of his term was to address the financial crisis which began in 2007. On the other hand, the economy has already largely recovered during Trump’s administration which is evidenced by statistics on economic growth and decreased unemployment rates.
Trump’s policies on tax cuts are generally viewed to favor citizens with higher incomes while those of Obama were meant to lessen income inequality by implementing higher taxes to those with equally bigger revenues. 
Federal Revenue Collections Forecast (2018-2025) for Trump vs Obama Economy The Obama baseline “CBO January 2017” forecast started at 3,600 which steadily increased to around 4,700 billion. As for Trump’s “2018 forecast”, it only started at around 3,350 billion which steadily increased to around 4, 625 billion. 
 Trump is generally perceived to favor businesses as reflected from his tax policies which leaned towards favoring high-revenue companies and individuals. Also, small-scale businesses are presently having very high hopes. Moreover, the current president is known to have much background in the corporate world. On the contrary, Obama is mostly viewed as anti-business which is also apparent from his policies on moderately increasing the taxes of those with higher income to fund his health-care program. 
Around 3.6 million jobs were created during Trump’s governance. Interestingly, survey shows that the unemployment rates for Latinos, African-Americans, and women are currently increasing at around 0.3 percent. However, these rates hardly increased during the Obama administration.
Economic growth decreased by about 0.5 percent in the final quarter of the previous administration as evidenced by the 2.3 percent growth in the second quarter of 2016 to only 1.8 percent in the last quarter. On the other hand, the present administration is charting an average economic growth of 2.9 percent and it is projected to increase at the end of 2018.
Trump has been known to initiate trade wars with several companies such as the Trans-Pacific partnership and with several countries like China and Mexico. On the contrary, such aggressive approach was not associated with Obama’s leadership.
The FY 2018 deficit under Trump’s watch had an estimated 60-percent-increase as compared to the projection of the CBO in 2017. Contrariwise, that of Obama’s decreased by 58 percent but the national debt increased by 88 percent. 
In computer architecture, a stack is a special region of the computer’s memory explicitly allotted for automatic variables. In programming, automatic variable is a local variable meaning the scope of the variable is local to the block in which it is declared. Memory is allocated automatically to these variables upon entry to the block and memory is freed upon exit. Heap, on the other hand, is the portion of computer’s memory used for dynamic memory allocations meaning blocks of memory are allocated and de-allocated in a random fashion.
Memory is allocated before the program is executed, generally at the compile time and the data structure used is called stack. Heap, on the other hand, is used for dynamic memory allocation meaning memory is allocated manually at the runtime during the execution of a program.
Programs request memory, usually for adding a node to the data structure and returns if not needed. A stack is managed and optimized by the CPU and the data is accessed in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) order.
Programs request memory, usually for adding a node to the data structure and returns if not needed. A stack is managed and optimized by the CPU and the data is accessed in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) order. LIFO refers to the method of data storage in memory stacks in which the most recent block of memory is the first to be freed and vice-versa. This makes for efficient memory management. Elements of the heap, on the contrary, are independent of each other and data can be accessed arbitrarily meaning a memory block can be allocated and freed at any time irrespective of their order.
Unlike in stack, memory is allocated as the program runs in heap which makes it a little slower to access the variables stored here. As there is no specific order in reserving blocks, memory blocks can be allocated and free at any time. 
Really, when it comes to deciding which word to use to talk about events at a meeting, it depends on timing. Just remember that agendas come before a meeting actually happens, like a plan, and minutes come after a meeting has occurred, like a summary. In this way the words, ‘agenda’ and ‘minutes’ can be used properly in Business English.
An ‘agenda’ refers to what is planned to discuss during a meeting. An agenda has a list of topics or subjects that will be covered. It serves as a plan or an outline what will happen. Therefore, an agenda is made before a meeting occurs. For example: Our manager sent out the agenda for tomorrow’s meeting so we knew what to expect. Other words that can be used are ‘program’, ‘schedule’ or ‘docket’, although ‘docket’ is usually used to refer to a list of legal cases that are going to be tried in court. However when referring to some type of meeting or gathering of people to discuss business, ‘agenda’ is the commonly used word. ‘Agenda’ is also commonly used in everyday English to refer to any time of plan. For example: What’s on the agenda for you to do today? The word, ‘minutes’ means a summary of proceedings or happenings as recorded in brief notes. When used in the context of a meeting, it is the official record of what happened, what was said, or what was decided at a meeting. So, minutes can only be recorded after a meeting has occurred. Many times a business meeting or other official meeting will start out with a secretary reading the minutes of the previous meeting to remind participants of that meeting or the minutes will be distributed following the meeting for reference purposes. For example: Bob’s secretary e-mails us the minutes from the staff meeting just in case we missed something
Wi-Fi is primarily a local area networking technology that uses radio waves to provide high-speed internet access to mobile devices enabled with Wi-Fi. It not only allows mobile devices such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets to connect to the internet but also allows them to communicate with each other wirelessly. Cellular is a networking technology typically associated with a mobile telephone system that uses short-range radio stations to facilitate mobile device communication over areas comprised of cells and transceivers. Cellular means there is a cellular plan attached to the device which uses cellular signal to connect to the internet.
Wi-Fi is a critical element and a crucial wireless networking technology based on the IEEE 802.11 standards. It is the Wi-Fi Alliance’s name for a wireless standard, or protocol, used for wireless communication. The Wi-Fi Alliance is a not-for-profit organization that certifies the interoperability of wireless devices to promote wireless technologies. It means any Wi-Fi enabled device can seamless communicate with another Wi-Fi enabled device wirelessly. Cellular refers to a mobile network which is distributed over a wide area commonly referred to as cells which are linked to one base station which in turn facilitates wireless connection via a mobile phone.
Wi-Fi enabled means if there is a wireless signal, the device can use the Wi-Fi standard to broadcast and receive information. It means anyone can work almost anywhere by using a mobile Wi-Fi device to connect to the internet without wires on-the-go. Wi-Fi is the name given to the wireless devices that are certified to use the 802.11 standard for communication. The main objective of a cellular communication network is to provide high-capacity coverage over a wide area and to provide a cost-effective solution for the networks in terms of coverage, capacity and quality. Mobile technology is the technology used for cellular communication.
Wi-Fi is perfect for data-intensive use such as online movies, YouTube, video conferencing, downloading music and videos, etc. Generally, Wi-Fi has no limit on how much data you can use in a day or a month. Cellular networks, on the other hand, use a proprietary frequency and a dedicated cellular operator and the services are chargeable based on weekly or monthly plans. Cellular data plans usually have daily or monthly cap on the data consumption limit. 
One of the primary difference between the two terms is their definition. Security refers to the protection of individuals, organizations, and properties against external threats that are likely to cause harm. It is clear that security is generally focused on ensuring that external factors do not cause trouble or unwelcome situation to the organization, individuals, and the properties within the premises. On the other hand, safety is the feeling of being protected from the factors that causes harm. It is also important to highlight that an individual who controls the risk causing factors has the feeling of being safe.
The second difference is that the feeling of being safe is an emotional aspect while security has to do with physical aspect. An individual feels safe when he or she is embraced by the loved ones which means that his or her emotional safety has been taken care of. Similarly, young children have the sense of being safe when they are close to their mother or father because he or she provides for both emotional and physical aspect. On the other hand, the aspect of security comes with physical aspects like tall walls that are protecting an individual from external threats. In addition, an individual has the sense of security if he or she has a physical weapon like gun that can be used to deal with external threats.
It is important to highlight that security is mostly an external affair while safety is an internal aspect. People looking for security ensure that they are highly protected against external factors that are likely to harm them. On the other hand, an individual within the organization might cause the essence of lacking safety or a party might make himself or herself not to feel safe. For example, security analyst and the forces mandated with ensuring security secure the perimeter of the organization, assets, or even an individual hence shielding against any external threats. However, they are not concerned with the internal aspects.
The other notable difference between security and safety is that security is the protection against deliberate threats while safety is the aspect of being secure against unintended threats. People and properties are usually protected against deliberate threats that are caused by criminals who have the intention to sabotage the operations of the company, steal resources of the organization, or harm an individual.
The other notable difference between security and safety is that security is the protection against deliberate threats while safety is the aspect of being secure against unintended threats. People and properties are usually protected against deliberate threats that are caused by criminals who have the intention to sabotage the operations of the company, steal resources of the organization, or harm an individual. This means that security is geared towards the protection against criminal activities that are perpetuated by criminals. On the other hand, the safety of a person is mostly installed so that a person can be protected against unintended accidents. For example, individuals are required to wear safety clothes in an organization that deals with chemicals so that they can be protected against the accidents.
An advertisement is the use of multimedia methods to promote activities, services or products by use of different avenues, with an aim of persuading potential consumers. On the other hand, propaganda is the act of influencing people by changing their attitudes and perceptions regarding the way they view certain products, services and even beliefs.
While advertisements aim at attracting public attention to a certain service or product and change consumer preference, propaganda aims at distorting facts and basing them on biased opinions hence is misleading to the target group.
The end result of advertising is a change of preference hence a purchase. On the other hand, the end result of propaganda is a show of superiority while making the other products seem inferior.
It also changes people’s mentality in regard to political, race, religious and lifestyle choices
While advertisements are used in the consumer market to promote new products, propaganda is not only used in the consumer market but also influences political, drugs, racism, sexuality, lifestyle and health choices. 
While advertising applies techniques such as dramatization, impact, description, imaging, frequency and positioning, propaganda applies techniques such as emotional manipulation, inaccuracies, exaggerations and generalization. 
Bronchitis is inflammation of the bronchi and trachea while bronchiolitis is infection and inflammation of the lower respiratory tract.
Bronchitis can affect people of all ages from infants to the elderly. Bronchiolitis only affects infants who are younger than two years of age.
Coughing, wheezing and difficulty breathing is a symptom of bronchitis. Coughing, wheezing, fast rate of breathing, difficulty breathing, cyanosis, and vomiting are symptoms seen in bronchiolitis.
Bronchitis is diagnosed by physical exam and by the use of chest X-rays to exclude other possible conditions. Bronchiolitis is diagnosed by physical exam, pulse oximetry, chest X-rays and RSV antigen tests.
Acute bronchitis can be caused by RSV, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, influenza type A, and influenza type B virus. Chronic bronchitis can be caused by smoking cigarettes.
Acute bronchitis can be caused by RSV, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, influenza type A, and influenza type B virus. Chronic bronchitis can be caused by smoking cigarettes. Bronchiolitis can be caused by RSV, rhinovirus, and parainfluenza virus type 3. A risk factor for chronic bronchitis is smoking or having COPD.
A risk factor for acute bronchitis is having an upper respiratory tract infection. A risk factor for bronchiolitis is being premature, a male infant, being born to a mother who smokes, and living in crowded conditions.
Bronchitis can be treated by the use of anti-inflammatory and pain medications and beta2-antagonists (such as albuterol), that are inhaled. Bronchiolitis is treated with fluids and oxygen therapy. 
E-cigs or electronic cigarettes, in its basic form are simply a combination of rechargeable lithium battery and disposable e-liquid cartridges. Electronic cigarettes are considered one of the best alternatives to traditional cigarette smoking and often referred to as personal vaporizers. 
Electronic cigarettes are considered one of the best alternatives to traditional cigarette smoking and often referred to as personal vaporizers. They are designed to imitate the look and feel of a real cigarette and even emulate the operation. Vaping, on the other hand, is quite similar to the act of smoking except vapor products are a little larger than electronic cigarettes.
Vaping banks on vaporizers to get you enjoy the pleasures the smoking without the effects. An electronic cigarette is a battery-powered device designed to emit vapors that can be inhaled afterwards.
An electronic cigarette is a battery-powered device designed to emit vapors that can be inhaled afterwards. The battery is attached to a heating element called an atomizer and a cartridge that holds the nicotine and other liquid and flavorings. In most e-cigarettes, the atomizer and the cartridge are combined into one device called a cartomizer. The battery then powers the atomizer to vaporize the liquid and the contents of the liquid create the ultimate emission.
Electronic cigarettes use pre-filled cartridges so they do not accommodate a wide variety of e-juice flavors and manipulating the device to add more flavors is a little tricky. They mostly use menthol, tobacco, and mint to imitate a real smoking experience. Advanced vaporizers are the newest addition to the conventional e-cigarettes that bring you a wide assortment of vape flavors including tobacco, menthol, fruits, desserts, beverages, etc. They can mix and match e-juices to create personalized vape e-cigarettes tailored for their tastes.
Efficiency and effectiveness are both commonly used management terms. Yet, while they sound similar and start with the same letters, they both mean different things. Efficiency refers to doing things in a right manner. Scientifically, it is defined as the output to input ratio and focuses on getting the maximum output with minimum resources. Effectiveness, on the other hand, refers to doing the right things. It constantly measures if the actual output meets the desired output.
Since efficiency is all about focusing on the process, importance is given to the ‘means’ of doing things whereas effectiveness focuses on achieving the ‘end’ goal.
Efficiency is concerned with the present state or the ‘status quo’. Thinking about the future and adding or eliminating any resources might disturb the current state of efficiency. Effectiveness, on the other hand, believes in meeting the end goal and therefore takes into consideration any variables that may change in the future.
In order to be efficient time and again, discipline and rigor is required. This can build inflexibility into the system. Effectiveness, on the other hand, keeps the long term strategy in mind and is thus more adaptable to the changing environment.
Since efficiency is about doing things right, it demands documentation and repetition of the same steps. Doing the same thing again and again in the same manner will certainly discourage innovation. On the other hand, effectiveness encourages innovation as it demands people to think, the different ways they can meet the desired goal.
Efficiency will look at avoiding mistakes or errors whereas effectiveness is about gaining success.
In the earlier days of mass production, efficiency was the most important performance indicator for any organization. However, with consumers facing an increasing number of choices, effectiveness of an organization is always questioned.
.Efficiency means doing the things right whereas Effectiveness is about doing the right things.
Efficiency focuses on the process or ‘means’ whereas Effectiveness focuses on the end.
Efficiency is restricted to the present state whereas effectiveness involves thinking long term.
Organizations have to be both effective and efficient in order to be successful.
