caulk used to seal gaps in exterior sliding, and any paint can be applied over it. Silicone caulk is used as a basic sealant used to prevent passage of water and air. The most common types of silicone sealants are acetoxy cure, oxime cure, and alcoxy cure. Acetoxy cure is ideal for internal uses, whereas oxime and alcoxy are good for external applications. Caulking is used to seal construction cracks in the body of the house, mainly between window frames and sliding. Caulking is commonly applied with a caulking gun that is loaded with cartridge of caulking compou
Bash is a newer shell compared to the KSH. Bash, as the newer shell, has more resources and more computer users. Bash is a free and public utility shell that is often used in open-source communities and applications.
All businesses are under the government’s control. The government provides the business an opportunity and legality to earn profits in return for taxes. Government laws regarding trade, operations, and transactions are implemented and incorporated in many business laws. A certain corporation or business must adhere to the existing government rules and standards aside from their own business practices and concerns.
 measurement as has its foundations from Roman legions and early Tudor rulers. On the contrary, kilometers as a unit was realized with the recognition of the metric system in the 18th to 19th century. Mile is spelled the same way in both British and American English. On the other hand, “kilometer” is the British as well as Australian English spelling. “Mileage” is literally meant as the number of miles traveled. Figuratively, it is the allowance for travel costs. I
 based on the original concept of martial arts: to kill an enemy. Karate is a hard martial art technique that requires one to execute hard punches first in order to develop muscular strength. Both techniques require greater power of the mind than physical strength. Aikido and Karate share many different features, like training evolution, discipline, and movement.
ecchymosis. These lesions may or may not be painful. The area surrounding the ecchymosis lesion may be inflamed and the lesion may spread to surrounding areas depending on the size of the ecchymosis. To summarise Purpura and Ecchymosis are reddish purple or bluish discolorations within the skin that occur spontaneously. They are non-raised lesions that change colour from red to purple or blue to yellowish green and finally
ial needs. Postal codes are not only used for reference in delivering packages but have also been used for other purposes which include designating destinations in route planning software, census enumeration, and calculating in
ithin a specific area. The structure of the postal code is formulated such that one or two letters or digits are named after a local city or town. The second digit represents the district in that region which are finally followed by a space and finally an arbitrary code of one number and two letters. There is a significant difference between the ZIP code and postal codes regarding their composition. A ZIP code contains numbers only since numerals have been used in identifying locations, businesses, private properties, and government parastatals in the Unite
T-Mobile is one of the largest network service providers in the United States and a fully-owned mobile communication subsidiary of the German telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom AG, the largest telecommunications provider in Europe. Headquartered in New York City, Verizon Wireless is a fully owned subsidiary of Verizon Communications and the largest wireless-communications service provider in the United States, delivering on its promise of creating a digital world.
Being the largest wireless-communications service provider in the United States, Verizon delivers the most reliable network coverage across the country, providing services to a broad range of consumers including individuals, businesses, and government agencies. T-Mobile, on the other hand, trails far behind Verizon in terms of 3G/4G network coverage.
Verizon may be the largest wireless service provider in the country. T-Mobile has the better pricing plans with a fewer restrictions and the right combo of extras and add-ons.
The base unlimited plan of T-Mobile starts at only $70 per month, which is $5 cheaper than the Verizon’s Go Unlimited plan.
Plus T-Mobile won’t slow you down unless you reach the 50 GB limit, whereas Verizon starts clamp you down at 22 GB.
Well, in terms of device selection, both T-Mobile and Verizon offer a great selection of mobile phones, including the latest flagships from Apple, Samsung, and others. Verizon, being the largest wireless service provider, shines in the premium phone segment as the only carrier to sell Google’s flagship Pixel phones. T-Mobile, on the other hand, excels in the budget phone segment with an extensive selection of under $200 phones. 
We have discussed above how the DDL and the DML work in our above discussion. The Truncate command is a DDL and it operates on the data structure level. But Delete is a DML command and it operates on the table data.
Other examples for DDL are CREATE and ALTER. In a similar way, we could say the commands such as SELECT, UPDATE, and INSERT is perfect examples for a DML.
As soon as we issue the Truncate command, it just looks for the specified table. Then it completely removes all the data from the memory. But the working procedure is little different in the case of a Delete. Here, the original table data is copied to space called the ‘Roll back’ space before doing the actual data manipulation. Then the alterations are done on the actual table data space.
Let us come to the Truncate and Delete with respect to the Roll back now. As we discussed above, the Truncate never uses a roll back space and we could not get back to the original data. But Delete command uses roll back space and we could just either use ‘Commit’ or ‘RollBack’ to accept or cancel the changes respectively.
For those who need an explanation about triggers, here is a little note. Triggers are a pre-specified set of operations/operation that should be activated when the table encounters a particular condition. For example, we could trigger changing the salary amount when an employee’s experience with the company is more than a year. These triggers could work on other tables as well. For example, we could update the finance table as soon as a hike in salary has been done for an employee. Truncate is a DDL command, the trigger is not allowed here. But a Delete is a DML command, Triggers are allowed here.
As you guessed, the Truncate command would be faster than the Delete command.
The former could remove all the data and there is no need to check for any matching conditions. Also, the original data is not copied to the rollback space and this saves a lot of time. These two factors make Truncate work faster than the Delete.
The ‘Where’ clause is used to specify certain matching conditions and is nothing to with the Truncate. As Truncate never looks for any matching conditions and it just removes all the rows, we could not use a ‘Where’ clause here. But we could always specify the condition with the help of the ‘where’ clause in the Delete command.
The degree of damage is typically higher among pollution cases as compared to contamination since pollutants often disturb ecosystems. On the other hand, contaminants do not usually inhibit life cycles.
For instance, water pollution due to mercury kills marine life while water contamination due to a fecal matter does not pose much danger.
Pollution is mostly associated with the environment whereas contamination may occur in a certain body or substance.
Water, air, and land pollution degrade the quality of flora and fauna while contamination may merely occur in a particular petri dish or similarly confined surface area.
Pollution is caused by man whereas contamination may be brought about by man or contaminants may be inherently present in the environment.
For instance, pollutants are commonly present in the byproducts of manufacturing industries while contaminants are already in the soil, water, and animal wastes.
Pollution can be due to chemical substances or energy such as light and sound. As for contamination, it is generally confined to substances.
Due to its graver impact, pollution is more associated with monitoring regulations as compared to contamination.
The term contamination is more likely associated with infectious disease than pollution.
Current and Voltage are two different but related aspects of electricity. Voltage is the electrical potential difference between two points while current is the flow of electric charge across a certain element. 
Voltage can take up many varying forms. There is AC Voltage, DC Voltage, and even static electricity that is also measured in Volts.
Let’s say that you have two water tanks. One is half empty while the other one is full.
Experts say that it is not the high voltage that kills a person when electrocuted; they say that it is the amount of current that flows through the heart of a person. 
1. Voltage is the difference in potential between two points 2. Current is the rate of flow of electricity across a given element.
3. Voltage divided by current is the resistance of the element. 4. Whether a person dies from electrocution is based on the current and not the voltage. 
Gout: Gout is a metabolic disease characterized by the accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints. Turf Toe: Turf toe is a painful injury or rupture of the connective tissue in the area of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the big toe.
Gout: Gout affects predominantly men. Turf Toe: Turf toe is most common in sports played on artificial terrain, like football, rugby, gymnastics, athletics, and martial arts.
Gout: The symptoms of gout include severe, sudden, and long lasting pain in the big toe, increased uric acid levels in the blood, increased protein levels in the blood, difficult movement of the joint, swelling and redness, kidney stones, kidney inflammation, high blood pressure. Turf Toe: The symptoms of turf toe include sudden acute pain at the time of the trauma, local swelling, limp.
Gout: Gout can be caused by a congenital defect in the purine metabolism, by a decreased renal excretion of the uric acid or by an unhealthy lifestyle. Turf Toe: The most common causes of turf toe are errors in the rehabilitation of previous sprains, joint instability, unsuitable worm up, unsuitable terrain surface, weakness or muscle fatigue, inappropriate sports shoes (soft or flexible soles).
Gout: Gout can be diagnosed based on the symptoms and content of uric acid in the blood. Additional tests like X-ray, ultrasonography, etc. may also be used. Turf Toe: In most cases, a detailed examination is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis. To exclude additional traumas such as fractures, radiography is usually done.
Gout: For treatment of gout are used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, and colchicine. The healthy diet and the limitation of alcohol intake are very important. Turf Toe: Immediately after the trauma, the principles of first aid for sports injuries apply, including compress with ice, compression bandage, rest and immobilization, painkillers and anti-inflammatory agents. After the acute symptoms resolve physiotherapy procedures may be applied, including massage, ultrasound therapy, taping and kinesio taping, thermal procedures, exercises. 
One of the main difference between tofu and paneer is their originality. Tofu is said to have originated from China some 2000 years ago while paneer is said to have originated from the Indian sub-continent. Many personalities around the globe are familiar with tofu because it is available in various outlets as Chinese manufacture and export it to other parts of the world. However, paneer is mostly used in India, which remains to be the place where it originated. Although there are other types of cheese sold in the western countries, they are significantly different from paneer.
The amounts of benefits obtained from tofu and paneer vary significantly. It is believed that tofu has high health benefits as compared to paneer. One of the main things that make tofu to have more benefits is because it has low calorie and high proteins as compared to paneer. This means that tofu does not add weight to individuals while at the same time ensuring that they are not prone to lifestyle diseases. This is not the same for paneer, which has high calorie and low protein content hence exposing people to increased weight, which can result in lifestyle diseases.
The other difference that exists between tofu and paneer is that the two products are produced from different raw materials. Paneer is predominantly produced from goat or cow milk while tofu can be produced from soybean despite it being produced from coagulated milk.
Fat content between tofu and paneer forms a significant difference, which is used by many people to decide on what to buy. Paneer has high-fat content while tofu has low-fat content. One of the main aspects that make paneer to have high-fat content is the fact that it is obtained from milk, which has a significant amount of fat while tofu is obtained from coagulated milk, which sometimes may not have large amounts of fat molecules. In addition, tofu can sometimes be derived from cereals like soybeans, which are known to have low-fat content.
Perishability and the state in which both tofu and paneer are sold offer a point of difference worth to note. Paneer is highly perishable because it is made from fresh milk while tofu can wait for a significant period without going bad because it is made from coagulated milk.
Besides, perishability of paneer makes it be sold only when fresh after which it will not be suitable for human consumption. On the other hand, tofu can be sold while fresh or even after processing.
It is also important to note that one can stock tofu for a more extended period while stocking paneer is not recommended unless one has a refrigerator to cool paneer cubes.
The physical aspects of paneer and tofu tend to vary which makes it possible for people to distinguish between the two products with ease. Tofu has a sour taste because it is formed by coagulation of milk. Furthermore, it is worth noting that tofu has some thick texture and slightly solid particles, especially the one extracted from soybeans. On the other hand, it is meriting that paneer has a sour to bitter taste because it is prepared by curdling mild with food acid like lemon juice and vinegar among others. It is also worth noting that paneer has a fine texture
Capital expenditure is a long-term expenditure and therefore has a long-term effect on the business. It is not exhausted within a current accounting year. Additionally, its benefits will be received for some years. Conversely, revenue expenditure is short-term. Its benefits are received within the current accounting year.
 Capital expenditure sees to it that an asset is procured or the value of an existing asset is improved. With revenue expenditure, neither the acquisition nor value enhancement of an asset is done.
Capital expenditure has a physical existence except for intangible assets. On the other hand, revenue expenditure has no physical presence as it is incurred on business items used in daily business operations.
Capital expenditure is non-recurring, unlike revenue expenditure which is regular and occurs repeatedly.
Capital expenditure helps a company progress the business while revenue expenditure helps maintain the business.
A portion of capital expenditure is usually shown in Trading, Profit and Loss account and the balance shown on the asset side in the balance sheet. With revenue expenditure, the whole amount is always shown in an income statement or the trading Profit and Loss account.
Capital expenditure is indicated on the balance sheet until its benefits are thoroughly exhausted. Contrariwise, revenue expenditure is not shown on the balance sheet
Capital Expenditure is capitalized, unlike revenue expenditure, which is not capitalized.
Capital expenditure does not reduce the revenue of the business. Fixed asset acquisition does not affect business revenue. Revenue expenditure impacts and reduces the business profits.
A goal is a target or a desired result. The aim is the process of orienting yourself and your actions towards a goal or an ambition.
An aim is like a relatively long term plan of action. When you aim, you try to see the bigger picture. The goal is the final point or level to reach at, and doing so in a sense brings closure to the aim that you had some time ago.
Let’s say you’re fascinated by hybrid cars and want to come up with one yourself. Your aim then becomes to get to see your ideas up and running on the roads. How do you go about it? You set yourself small goals, carefully thought out to achieve the said aim. These goals can be designing the engine, selecting the fuel, designing the car itself and so on.
The acromegaly is a disorder in which there is an excess of growth hormone secreted beginning sometime between ages 20 to 40. The gigantism is a disorder in which there is which there is an excess of growth hormone secreted during childhood.
Acromegaly develops during early to middle adulthood. Gigantism always develops during childhood before the bones’ growth plates have fused.
In acromegaly, the tongue often changes size and shape, the jaw also protrudes and the lips thicken. In gigantism the jaw becomes prominent and the forehead protrudes.
A person with acromegaly does not experience an increase in height because the condition starts in adulthood. A person with gigantism does have increased height because they are children who are still growing.
Acromegaly develops after puberty and during adulthood so the onset is unaffected. Gigantism develops before puberty and therefore can cause a delay in the onset of puberty. 
The gonads (reproductive organs) are not affected by acromegaly since the person is an adult when the condition starts. The gonads are affected though in gigantism since the person is a child when the problem begins.
Acromegaly is caused by a noncancerous pituitary tumor or non-pituitary tumor of the lungs or other parts of the brain. Gigantism is caused by a noncancerous pituitary tumor, McCune-Albright syndrome, Carney complex, neurofibromatosis and also certain endocrine neoplasias.
