 The vehicle has the capacity to carry luggage since it has bigger space. UberGo offers services that are relatively cheaper since it is also simple. The services that are offered by UberX are comparatively expensive. The base charge for the first four kilometers is high compared to UberGo. The waiting charge is also higher compared to UberGo. UberGo does not offer extra facilities like wifi. This is one of the reasons why its services are generally cheaper. UberGo does not change from its original state and form. UberX offers extra facilities such as Wif
